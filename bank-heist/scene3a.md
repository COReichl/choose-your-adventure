# Open the door

You hold the device up to the lock of the door, and instead of sending a gentle volt of electricity to fry the lock, a large arc of electricity shoots out of the device, zapping both you and the lock. You're unsure if that will be fixable, but you continue on into the building.



Entering the door, you see a bland break room. There are very few pieces of furniture in the room. A table and a few chairs stand in the center. Off to the side, a vending machine and a fridge are squished against the wall by a long countertop with a lone microwave. Across the room, you spot the only other door. There's no telling what's behind it.



Your only other means of escaping the room is leaving the way you came, but you've already wasted far too much time and equipment getting in here, so you'd have to flee the scene after leaving.

Where do you go?
