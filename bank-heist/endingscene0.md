# You Failed the Mission
## Rank: Not a Robber

Unable to complete the mission, you and your crew sadly sulk back out the rear entrance, getting drenched as you leave; the rain seems to have restarted while you were inside. Drenched and disappointed, you and your crew climb back into the van.

Your getaway driver turns around, takes one look at the crew, and without any questions, drives away from the bank.
