# The Calm Before the Storm

The city sleeps under a blanket of fog, its streets slick with the remnants of an evening rain. You and your crew are parked two blocks from the First National Bank, the engine of your nondescript van humming quietly. Tonight is the night everything changes.  

Your crew is nervous but ready. On the table between you lie the blueprints of the bank, the getaway maps, and the list of security measures. Your heart races as you double-check your equipment: masks, guns, and the one tool that could make or break the jobâ€”the electronic lock bypass device.  

You glance at your watch. Midnight. The streets are quiet. The bank looms ahead, dark except for the faint glow of the security cameras.  

What do you do first?
