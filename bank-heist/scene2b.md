# The Lobby

You step off the sidewalk into the bank’s marble foyer. The morning light spills across the polished floor. A brass plaque by the door reads First North Trust. You’re dressed to blend in — a plain jacket, a tote bag, a neutral face. 

Inside: customers, two tellers, a branch manager behind glass, a security guard who looks bored, and a smear of nervous energy at the entrance where a kid is fiddling with a tablet. You didn’t come for a routine withdrawal. You came for one thing — but how far will you go?

You walk in and join the line. People chat, the coffee machine hums. A bank employee glances up and smiles politely.

What do you do?
