# Enter the Hallway

You carefully open the door. It silently slides open to reveal a similarly blank hallway. From what you know, there shouldn't be any cameras here, but strangely, there are no guards either.

To the left, the hallway leads down into what appears to be the back of the teller's station. You'll have to be cautious when going around to avoid getting caught. To the right, you notice what appears to be a continuation of the vent from outside you could see if it leads anywhere. Straight ahead looms the bank vault, what would've been a great sight for your crew if your lock bypass device were still working.

Where do you go?
