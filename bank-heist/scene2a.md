# Scoping Out the Bank From the Alley

You and your crew gather up the equipment you'll need and exit the van. To the right stands a dark, foreboding alley—normally no one would even consider walking down it, but your crew quickly scrambles in and hides in the cover of the alley's darkness.

The wall of the bank is simple: a bland concrete slab that stretches far higher than you could climb. At the back end stands a single door with a sign reading, _FIRE EXIT PLEASE KEEP CLEAR_. The door is new—clearly not something you can break down—but maybe you could bypass the lock with the device you brought.

A little to the side of the door, behind a few boxes, is the large face of a vent. It's rusty enough to pry off, but it would be risky for all of you to travel through it. Most of your crew would have to head back to the van, although you'd save the charge on the lock‑bypass device.

Which entrance do you choose?
